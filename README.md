# Is Pericos Crowded

### This has has been discontinued
After months of beta testing, I found GPS data to be an unreliable indicator of actual crowd levels. This is because only Android (not iOS) GPS data is made publicly available, and the ratio of Android to iOS users in a small geographic location like a taqueria, is very erratic and cannot be used to infer real-world crowd levels.
Rather than provide unreliable crowd readings to users, I decided to discontinue the app.

### Intro
Hello Pericos fam! This web app displays how crowded Taqueria Los Pericos is, so you're never surprised by a line.
I built this as a sort of public service for the city of Santa Cruz.
